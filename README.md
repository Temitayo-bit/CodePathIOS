Name of your app is an app that allows users to change the screen color to a random color by tapping a button. The app provides a simple and interactive interface with labels and a button for user interaction.  

Time spent:  1 hour in total.



## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users see a screen with three labels and a button.
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color.


## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

An app I would love to work on is one that connects hairdressers and barbers on campuses with students who need hair services. This app would:
- Allow hairdressers and barbers to list their services, availability, and pricing.
- Enable students to book appointments, rate services, and leave reviews.
- Include cool features like location tracking for nearby professionals, in-app payments, and customizable profiles for service providers.
- Potentially expand beyond campuses to local neighborhoods.

## Notes

Some challenges encountered while building the app:
- Understanding how to implement the random color-changing feature efficiently.
- Debugging minor issues with the user interface layout.



## Personal Favorites

Here are some apps I love and their standout features:
1. WhatsApp: The search functionality makes it easy to locate messages.
2. FaceTime: The celebratory features and emojis during calls enhance the experience.
3. Snapchat: I appreciate how messages disappear, helping save storage space.
